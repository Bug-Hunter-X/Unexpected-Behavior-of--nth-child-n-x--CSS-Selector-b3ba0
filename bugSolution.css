To select every other element starting from the second one, use the `:nth-child(an+b)` selector.  To select elements starting from the second and incrementing by two, you should use `:nth-child(2n)` instead of `:nth-child(2n+1)`. This will correctly select the second, fourth, sixth, and so on.  For more complex selections, consider using a more specific selector or JavaScript to target the exact elements.
